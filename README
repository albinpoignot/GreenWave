Welcome in GreenWave.

This project come from our classes and the subject is given by a teacher. We have to simulate the workflow of some vehicules on a neighbourhood. Every cross-road has traffic lights. The program should help to find the best solution to limit the pollution.

Your help is welcome if you want to.
